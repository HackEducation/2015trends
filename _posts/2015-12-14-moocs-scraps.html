<p><em>I also wanted to make note some of the news items that didn't make the story. So I've decided to include those below.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-consortiums-mission-improve-liberal-arts-teaching-online/56621">The Chronicle of Higher Education reports</a> that &#8220;Four liberal-arts colleges on Monday formed a consortium to share information about their experiments with online education, and more members may soon join in.&#8221; It does not, however, report the name of the consortium, which I&#8217;m hoping is LiberalArtsX or UberLearn or Voracity or something like that.</p>

It does remind me of <a href="http://harvardx.harvard.edu/files/harvardx/files/ses_and_mooc_enrollment_lak_colloquium_hx_working_paper_submission3.pdf">what Justin Reich found in his research on those in HarvardX courses</a>: that those signing up for MOOCs were more affluent than average and more likely to come from families with high levels of parental educational attainment. But do carry on, NYT, with your MOOC hype.</p>

She said these two changes would allow universities and colleges to use Coursera&#8217;s online teaching packages in place of regular lectures allowing them to teach in areas where they don&#8217;t have enough in-house expertise.&#8221; The arc of ed-tech &#8220;innovation&#8221; is long and it bends towards the LMS, I guess.</p>

Perhaps it was recognition for his work on AllLearn? (Probably not.)</p>
