<p>Having just wrapped up the <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com">2014 Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>, I'm far too exhausted to do much other than create this subdomain, take a deep breath, and act like I am looking forward to the new year.</p> 

<p>That being said, I promise to do a better job keeping this GitHub repo updated. I will post each week a link to the Hack Education Weekly News, for example. And from time-to-time, I'll make notes here about what I think the major trends of 2015 look to be.</p>
