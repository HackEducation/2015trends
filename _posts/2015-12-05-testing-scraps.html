<p><em>I've published the second article in my "Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2015" series. <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com/testing.html">You can find it here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Coal-rich West Virginia opted to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/13/us/west-virginia-revisits-science-standards.html">change its version</a> of the Next Generation Science Standards to express doubts about climate change, but then <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/us/west-virginia-withdraws-altered-climate-curriculum.html">reversed its decision</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are the states that really have the best schools in the US,&#8221; <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/10/26/9617514/test-scores-naep-2013">Vox suggests</a> &#8211; that is if you look at test scores and adjust for student demographics.</p>
