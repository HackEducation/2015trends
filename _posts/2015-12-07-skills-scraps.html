<p><em>I've published the third article in my "Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2015" series. <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com/skills.html">You can find it here</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>I also wanted to make note some of the news items that didn't make the story. So I've decided to include those below.</em></p>

<p>Code.org has <a href="http://code.org/educate/3rdparty">new curriculum partners</a>, including Code Studio, ScratchEd, Codeacademy, Amplify Education, Beauty and Joy of Computing, Bootstrap, CodeHS, Globaloria, National Math and Science Initiative, Project Lead the Way, Technology Education And Literacy in Schools, and Tynker.</p>

<p>LinkedIn is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/09/linkedin-to-buy-online-education-site-lynda-com-for-1-5-billion/">buying</a> Lynda.com for $1.5 billion. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/linkedins-ceo-1-5b-buy-will-make-smarter/">Wired&#8217;s #hottake</a>: &#8220;LinkedIn’s CEO Thinks His $1.5B Buy Will Make You Smarter.&#8221; <a href="http://recode.net/2015/04/09/three-reasons-linkedin-broke-the-bank-for-lynda-com/">Re/Code&#8217;s #hottake</a>: &#8220;Three Reasons LinkedIn Broke the Bank for Lynda.com.&#8221;</p>

<p>Private equity investor Stephen Schwarzmann thinks that public schools should not get more money but can instead be “fixed” with unpaid labor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve always wondered, what you do in a society with people who just retire,” he told conference attendees. “If you could get those people, like a board, [to be an] unpaid workforce, pay them next to nothing or nothing, and have them go into the school system to be mentors to kids, and be an example of a certain type of success that you would get dramatically different outcomes. If you can get unemployed people that cost nothing, that can have this dramatic difference, that costs nothing. I love things that cost nothing that have great results. Imagine if you laid on technology and other types of things, you could really set the world on fire with this type of stuff.</p>
