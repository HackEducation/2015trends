<p><em>I've published the seventh article in my "Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2015" series. <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com/data.html">You can find it here</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>I also wanted to make note some of the news items that didn't make the story. So I've decided to include those below.</em></p>

<p>The University of Florida is <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/01/29/u-florida-change-name-isis-records-system">changing the name</a> of its ISIS student record system so that no one will confuse it with the Islamic terrorist group. Because Florida.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-02-12-how-k-12-can-improve-personalized-learning-with-a-corporate-tool">Edsurge asks</a>, &#8220;How K&#8211;12 Can Improve Personalized Learning With a Corporate Tool?&#8221; (For what it&#8217;s worth, the topic of the story, the Tin Can API has its roots as a military tool not a corporate tool. But hey, what&#8217;s a little ed-tech history among friends.)</p>

<p>CUNY adjunct professor (and former CIA director) David Petraeus <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/david-petraeus-guilty-plea-deal-obama-leaks/386731/">reached a plea deal</a> for leaking classified information to his mistress/biographer. Unlike other leaders, he won&#8217;t serve jail time. He&#8217;ll pay a $40,000 file and get 2 years of probation.</p>

<p><a href="http://laschoolreport.com/la-unified-unveils-a-new-and-improved-so-far-misis-system-lausd/">According to LA School Report</a>, LAUSD&#8217;s new student information system is finally operational.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/penn-state-frat-suspended-over-192432746.html">Via the AP</a>: &#8220;A Penn State University fraternity was suspended for a year Tuesday after police began investigating allegations that members used a private, invitation-only Facebook page to post photos of nude and partly nude women, some apparently asleep or passed out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Learnsprout&#8217;s Paul Smith offers a look at &#8220;<a href="https://medium.com/@prsmith2009/journey-into-the-center-of-the-world-of-student-information-systems-cea16d464597">the world of student information systems</a>.&#8221; (For what it&#8217;s worth, this line strikes me as dangerous techno-solutionism: &#8220; If the SIS isn’t ship shape, Johnny’s not getting into Harvard.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;Are Colleges Invading Their Students&#8217; Privacy?&#8221; <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/04/is-big-brothers-eye-on-campus/389643/">asks The Atlantic</a>. Duh? </p>

<p>Apple Watch is officially out, and I&#8217;ve been getting the email pitches from companies bragging they have an app on it. PBS Kids&#8217; Apple Watch app will let you control your children&#8217;s viewing on the PBS Kids iOS app. Sounds progressive. And <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/wearable-teaching-college-to-experiment-with-apple-watch-as-learning-tool/56459">according to The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, Penn State will experiment with Apple Watch on campus this fall. It bought 8 watches, so yeah&#8230; Not really a one-to-one wearable computing initiative, I guess.</p>

<p>Well, here&#8217;s a chilling headline from Edsurge: "<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-05-11-how-bank-regulation-applies-to-student-data-privacy">How Bank Regulation Applies to Student Data Privacy</a>.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hal Friedlander, the department&#8217;s chief information officer, said on Tuesday that NYC Schools was designed internally for less than $2 million and was expected to cost under $4 million for further development over the next four years. By contrast, ARIS, developed by IBM and a group of subcontractors, cost the Education Department $95 million from 2007 to 2014. Department officials said that only 3 percent of parents used it. Teachers and principals used it more often, but a 2012 audit report by the city comptroller found that nearly half of them had not logged into the system during the previous year.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/08/open_education_resources_adaptive_technology.html">Education Week frames the story</a> of Knewton&#8217;s product release as about OER, highlighting how misused the word &#8220;open&#8221; is in ed-tech. The headline changed on Buzzfeed&#8217;s coverage, but you can still see it in the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/knewton-a-hyped-ed-tech-startup-moves-into-the-mainstream#.gbGG8MNyG">URL slug</a>.

<p>Westmont College is <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/230661/">scanning its students&#8217; brains</a> to see if they&#8217;re learning. I love this quote: </p>

<p>&#8220;I was trying to think of something more ridiculous, but I couldn't,&#8221; said Robert A. Burton, a neurologist and author of <em>A Skeptic's Guide to the Mind: What Neuroscience Can and Cannot Tell Us About Ourselves</em>.</p>

<p>Need another hint that &#8220;adaptive learning&#8221; is mostly meaningless marketing fluff? Here you go: <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/04/knewton_hp_reach_deal_to_craft_adaptive_materials.html">Knewton and HP are teaming up to offer adaptive textbooks&#8230; in print</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of &#8220;personalization,&#8221; Inside Higher Ed&#8217;s Carl Straumsheim wrote about the so-called adaptive software offered by JumpCourse, demonstrating that it was pretty easy to guess one&#8217;s way through the coursework, something that can eventually lead to ACE credit: &#8220;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/31/exploring-jumpcourse-alternative-online-education-provider">General Ed Cheap and Easy</a>.&#8221; As adaptive learning CEOs are wont to do, the CEO invokes &#8220;learning styles&#8221; (in part) as to why this is all okay.</p>

Uber&#8217;s former head of global security Michael Ginty has been appointed to head of safety at AltSchool. Former Rocket Fuel VP Sue Yoon and former Zynga Director of Product Rajiv Bhatia are also joining.” Because education is an engineering problem, clearly. </p>

<p>Carey's <a href="http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/our-schools-all-have-a-tragic-flaw-silicon-valley-thinks-it-has-the-answer">article</a> was accompanied with a sidebar, a rewriting of the history of "personalized education,"" crediting Stanford University's Patrick Suppes as its "<a href="http://www.psmag.com/books-and-culture/the-intellectual-father-of-personalized-education">intellectual father</a>." Of course, Jean-Jacques Rousseau was not in Silicon Valley when he penned Emile, so I guess that history does not count.</p>

<p>Following criticism of an early version of a student privacy bill, its introduction was <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/03/federal_student_data_privacy_bill_delayed.html">delayed</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/01/federal_student-data-privacy_draft_bill.html">Education Week obtained a draft</a> of President Obama&#8217;s proposed &#8220;Student Digital Privacy Act&#8221; which has apparently been renamed to include the word &#8220;innovation.&#8221; &#8220;Unlike the California law, the draft version of the proposed federal bill obtained by Education Week does not contain an explicit prohibition on vendors amassing profiles of K-12 students for non-educational uses. Nor does the draft federal bill follow California's approach of prohibiting vendors from collecting student information via an educational site, service, or application, then using that information to target advertising to students elsewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>FERPA dictates that students (and until they&#8217;re 18, their parents) can access their education records. <a href="http://www.joannejacobs.com/2015/07/mom-billed-77k-for-disabled-sons-records/">According to Reason</a>, the Goodrich Area Schools in Michigan initially billed a mom $77,718.75 when she demanded access to her son&#8217;s records.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its authors, Alex Molnar and Faith Boninger, both University of Colorado researchers, recommend that legal protections be extended beyond students&#8217; formal educational records to include the wide range of student data &#8211; including anonymous information and &#8220;metadata,&#8221; such as what type of device a student is using or where they are accessing the Internet &#8211; that is now frequently collected and shared by ed-tech companies. The researchers also recommend that the legal burden to protect students&#8217; information be shifted to include vendors, as well as schools and districts.</p>
