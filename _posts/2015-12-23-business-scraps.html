<p><em>I've published the final article in my "Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2015" series. <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">You can find it here</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>I also wanted to make note some of the news items that didn't make the story. So I've decided to include those below.</em></p>

<p>From The New York Times, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/magazine/inside-a-chinese-test-prep-factory.html">Inside a Chinese Test Prep Factory</a>."</p>

<p>UMass is <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/01/13/umass-amherst-will-source-textbooks-from-amazon/">outsourcing</a> textbook sales to Amazon.</p>

<p><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2013031">Amazon opens</a> its &#8220;First-Ever Staffed Campus Pickup and Drop-Off Location, Free One-Day Pickup at Purdue University.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uber and Carnegie Mellon University announced <a href="http://blog.uber.com/carnegie-mellon">a strategic partnership</a> that &#8220;includes the creation of the Uber Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, near the CMU campus. The center will focus on the development of key long-term technologies that advance Uber's mission of bringing safe, reliable transportation to everyone, everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>A district judge in Idaho has <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2015/02/11/3640728_judge-voids-broadband-contract.html">voided</a> the state&#8217;s broadband contract (which supports its school broadband program), arguing that the state violated procurement laws when it gave CenturyLink (formerly Qwest) the deal to provide schools broadband. </p>

<p>&#8220;The Education Department is beefing up its oversight over the hundreds of different companies that colleges hire for a wide range of services that it says are somehow related to federal student aid dollars and therefore subject to regulation,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/06/08/education-department-steps-oversight-companies-hired-colleges">according to Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/07/amazon_top_pick_for_contract_to_create_nyc_schools_e-book_marketplace.html">Via Education Week</a>: &#8220;Amazon Digital Services Inc. would create a comprehensive online shopping source for e-books and digital content available for New York City schools, under a $30 million contract that is expected to be approved next month, the city&#8217;s department of education confirmed Thursday.&#8221; Teachers (well, and Amazon of course) will be able to see what their students are reading and how quickly they&#8217;re doing so. Gee, no privacy concerns here.</p>

<p>Financing startup Neighborly <a href="http://blog.neighborly.com/news/neighborly-introduces-civic-microbonds/">announced</a> that it&#8217;s selling the first ever &#8220;microbonds&#8221; for a public project, namely San Leandro Schools.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/10/new_website_details_state_policies_for_acquiring_digital_learning_content.html">According to Education Week</a>, the State Educational Technology Directors Association (SETDA) has created a database &#8220;with details about how each state, Guam, and the Mariana Islands approaches the procurement of digital education resources.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Wired headline reads &#8220;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/online-game-thatll-help-pay-off-student-debt/">An Online Game That'll Help Pay Off Your Student Debt</a>.&#8221; Actually you get $.50 if you win a round on the app&#8217;s trivia game. $.30 of that goes to pay a service fee. So at that rate, I&#8217;d need to play about 100,000 rounds before I had my debt paid off. That does nothing to address larger structural questions about student loan debt, but hey, this is clearly technosolutionism at its best/worst.</p>

<p>Private equity investor Stephen Schwarzmann thinks that public schools should not get more money but can instead be &#8220;fixed&#8221; with unpaid labor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wondered, what you do in a society with people who just retire,&#8221; he told conference attendees. &#8220;If you could get those people, like a board, [to be an] unpaid workforce, pay them next to nothing or nothing, and have them go into the school system to be mentors to kids, and be an example of a certain type of success that you would get dramatically different outcomes. If you can get unemployed people that cost nothing, that can have this dramatic difference, that costs nothing. I love things that cost nothing that have great results. Imagine if you laid on technology and other types of things, you could really set the world on fire with this type of stuff.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/02/06/hack-education-weekly-news/">news a couple months ago</a> about Uber&#8217;s partnership with Carnegie Mellon to create a lab to build robot-driven cars? Looks like it was really just an effort by Uber to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/5/19/8622831/uber-self-driving-cars-carnegie-mellon-poached">poach AI folks from the university</a>. &#8220;These guys, they took everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>University of Iowa will have a new president this fall, former IBM senior vice president Bruce Harreld. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/09/04/appointment-businessman-bruce-harreld-next-u-iowa-president-upsets-faculty">Faculty and grad students are not pleased</a>, pointing out his utter lack of experience in higher ed administration.</p>

<p>Uber is giving Carnegie Mellon <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/uber-gives-carnegie-mellon-millions-poaching-profs/">$5.5 million</a> to sponsor a new faculty chair in robotics (this after poaching many of the professors in its robotics department). </p>

The company specializes in refinancing student loans and was already the largest investment in ed-tech of the year, having raised $200 million in January. This round was led by Soft Bank and brings the total raised by SoFi to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/social-finance#/entity">$1.77 billion</a>.</p>

<p>According to a report by MDR, schools&#8217; instructional spending went up 9% in the 2013&#8211;2014 school year. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-08-01-out-of-the-slump-us-k-12-instructional-spending-jumps-964-million">&#8220;Remarkable,&#8221; says Edsurge</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in tech investing: &#8220;Nearly every week, all around the world, wealthy people, self-made business owners and senior executives in a range of industries gather at private clubs, cultural centers or five-star hotels for free, invitation-only angel investing &#8216;boot camps&#8217; intended to help them size up fledgling business ideas and the people behind them. The events are organized by Angel Labs, a global angel investor academy based in San Francisco whose mission is to widen the influence of angel investing, a field in which the relatively affluent put money into start-ups, usually in the tech industry.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/business/dealbook/a-global-academys-crash-course-makes-angels-out-of-investors.html">More via The New York Times</a>.</p>

It was a conveniently timed news release to distract us from <em>The Prize</em>, a new book by Dale Russakoff that details what happened to Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s $100 million donation to the Newark Schools. (Remember how Zuckerberg made a $100 million donation to the Newark Schools to distract us from the unflattering portrayal of him in <em>The Social Network</em>? The beat goes on&#8230;) Related: Edsurge covered how some of that money is being <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-09-03-zuckerberg-backed-foundation-gives-newark-teachers-back-to-school-gift">funneled</a> to teachers via a startup called ClassWallet (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classwallet">its list of funders here</a>): &#8220;Teachers will each receive $100 in ClassWallet credit that can be spent on supplies sold by 40 partnering vendors, including Amazon, Scholastic and Best Buy.

<p>Pearson has <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/pearson-ft-nikkei/">sold</a> the Financial Times to Japanese media company Nikkei for $1.3 billion. Pearson will now be &#8220;be 100 percent focused on our global education strategy,&#8221; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/07/pearson_to_sell_financial_times_to_focus_solely_on_global_education_strategy.html">CEO John Fallon says</a>.

<p>Quarterly financials were reported from <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2u-inc-reports-second-quarter-2015-financial-results-300125225.html">2U</a> (whose revenue is up), <a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/bridgepoint-education-posts-net-losses-for-latest-quarter/403559/">Bridgepoint Education</a> (which posted a net loss), and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/itt-stock-drops-40-as-for-profit-college-industry-struggles#.fbAwvOLjw">ITT</a> (admitted to precipitously declining enrollments, prompting its stock to fall 40%).</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/01/k12_inc_is_second_largest_gainer_on_new_york_stock_exchange.html">Via Education Week</a>: &#8220;K12 Inc., a publicly traded online education company that had experienced significant drops in its stock value in recent years, was the second highest &#8216;gainer&#8217; on the New York Stock Exchange at the close of business on Thursday, following the release of its second quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2015.&#8221; In other words, the stock market loves cheap, shoddy, shady for-profit online education. Nice.</p>

<p>Still struggling with its technology implementation &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; LAUSD, which announced it would <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/lausd-delays-delivery-again-of-more-than-19000-laptops/">delay</a> distribution of some 19,000 laptops. </p>

<p>Via KPCC: &#8220;<a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/09/25/54648/lausd-board-to-vote-on-6-4-million-settlement-prop/">LAUSD board to vote on $6.4 million settlement proposal with Apple over iPad software</a>.&#8221; Meanwhile, &#8220;<a href="http://laschoolreport.com/lausd-hunting-down-the-last-500-missing-computer-devices/">LAUSD hunting down the last 500 missing computer devices</a>.&#8221; </p>

<p>Looks like LAUSD cannot afford one iPad (or computer) for every student and staff after all. Instead, the Superintendent Ramon Cortines <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-la-school-district--computers-20150220-story.html">said</a> &#8220;the L.A.

<p>Shocking, I know, but LAUSD is &#8220;&#8216;extremely dissatisfied&#8217; with the work of Pearson on its technology initiative.&#8221; <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/04/15/51027/lausd-ipad-program-ditching-pearson-software-reque/">Local NPR affiliate SCPR reports</a> that the district is asking for a refund from Apple for the Pearson software that came bundled with its massive iPad purchase.</p>
