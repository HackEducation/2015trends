<p>I have gone through to clean up some of the broken links in this year's series of articles. If you notice any, <a href="mailto:mail@audreywatters.com">please let me know</a>.</p> 

<p>(If you notice any on Hack Education in particular, do try removing the trailing slash (/) at the end of the URL. That should do the trick.)</p>
